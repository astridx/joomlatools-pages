## What is Joomlatools Pages?

Joomlatools Pages is a simple, static content generator for **[Joomla](http://www.joomla.org)**. It's inspired by the ideas 
and concepts of flat-file CMS systems like [Jekhyll]( https://jekyllrb.com), [Grav](https://getgrav.org/), etc. Pages takes 
your html content or renders Markdown, Twig, Joomla templates, ... spits out the result and injects it in your site.

## Why Joomlatools Pages?

At Joomlatools we often need to include static content into a Joomla site, using articles for this is cumbersome and comes 
with many challenges, developing a custom component would be too much overhead. Pages solves this in an elegant and 
simple way, and not to mention it's super fast too!

## Who is Joomlatools Pages for?

Joomlatools Pages is for website developers and designers who create bespoke Joomla sites and have experience with html, 
markdown, etc.
