## What is Joomlatools Pages?

Joomlatools Pages is a simple, static content generato for **[Joomla](http://www.joomla.org)**. It's inspired by the ideas 
and concepts of flat-file CMS systems like [Jekhyll]( https://jekyllrb.com), [Grav](https://getgrav.org/), etc. Pages takes 
your html content or renders Markdown, Twig, Joomla templates, ... and spits out the content and injects it in your site.

It's developed and maintained by [Timble](http://timble.net) with the help of passionate developers from all over the world.
